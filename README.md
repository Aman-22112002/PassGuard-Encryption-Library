Title: C++ Password Encryption Library

Description:
This C++ library provides a simple and efficient password encryption mechanism using bit manipulation techniques. It encrypts passwords and verifies their correctness, ensuring a basic level of security.

Features:
1. Encryption: Encrypts passwords using a custom bit manipulation algorithm.
2. Verification: Verifies the correctness of encrypted passwords.
3. Simplicity: Easy-to-use API for integration into various applications.
4. Efficiency: Optimized for performance.

Limitations:
Basic security: This encryption method is not suitable for highly sensitive data.
Limited customization: The encryption algorithm is fixed and may not be suitable for all use cases.

Note:
For more robust password encryption, consider using cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL or Crypto++.
This library is provided as a basic example and should be adapted to your specific needs.
